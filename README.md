👋 Hi, I’m Kim Harold

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with ~2 years of experience building production-used internal systems using Laravel, React, and TypeScript. I focus on practical solutions, real-time applications, and workflow automation.

🚀 Projects
🔹 Real-Time Event Tabulation System

Laravel · React · TypeScript · WebSockets

A real-time tabulation system used during live judged events. Supports multiple judges scoring multiple contestants simultaneously, with instant result updates, point-based and rank-based scoring, and on-the-spot result printing.

🔹 Department-Based ID Generation System

Laravel · React · RBAC

A role-based internal tool that allows departments to generate and print employee IDs independently while enforcing access controls and consistent templates, reducing HR bottlenecks.

🔹 Attendance Monitoring System

Laravel · QR / Barcode Scanning

An event-based attendance system built for rapid deployment. Supports QR scanning, barcode scanning, and manual lookup for time-in/time-out tracking, with printable daily time records.

🛠 Tech Stack

Backend: PHP (Laravel), REST APIs, WebSockets

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

Database: MySQL, Eloquent ORM

Tools: Git, GitHub, Docker (basic)

📌 Notes

Some media shows actual events where these systems were deployed.

Projects prioritize real-world usage and delivery over academic examples.
