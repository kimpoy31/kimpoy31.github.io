Portfolio – Kim Harold Pinanonang

This repository contains my personal developer portfolio showcasing selected projects I’ve built and worked on, primarily focused on internal systems, real-time applications, and workflow automation.

The projects featured here reflect real-world usage, including systems deployed and used by an HR department during live events and daily operations.
